Each year the majority of working Americans set personal goals as New Year’s resolutions, often electing to slim down, eat healthier or break bad habits in hopes of bettering their wellbeing. Such personal resolutions undoubtedly affect our personal life, but I wonder … because most full-time employees spend the majority of their conscious time at work, why don’t more people set work resolutions? If we could make changes at work to be a little more efficient and organized, how would it affect our personal wellbeing and life at home? I’m guessing we’d have a little less stress, a little more free time, and an increased sense of ease.

Here are a few work resolutions to make you a more efficient employee this year. And remember… you’re doing it for YOU, but it won’t hurt if the boss notices too ;)

Quit Multitasking
-----------------
It’s a proven and well-known fact that multi-tasking actually hurts (rather than helps) productivity. Though it’s hard to avoid the constant disruptions of pinging emails, text alerts or ringing phones, you need to find a way to shut them off while you focus on work. While performing work tasks, keep your cell phone in a drawer on silent, set your computer to mute, and direct incoming calls straight to voicemail. Check your messages in between projects and tasks throughout the day.

Drink water and snack right
---------------------------
Dehydration and high-carbohydrate diets can leave your body fatigued and your brain foggy. For optimal performance, enthusiasm and sharpness, it’s important to give your body the nutrients it needs. Look to this list of healthy desk-friendly snacks from Cooking Light for ideas.

Make Your Commute Count
-----------------------
Ever wish you had more time at the office to clear your head and focus on one thing for an extended period of time? The commute is a great time for brainstorming. Get into the habit of selecting one task at the end of each day that you will “think on” as you go to work the next day. You’ll arrive at the office ready to dive in and may be even more inspired to get started with a plan already populated in your mind.
