The Washington Island Ferry Line is the only source of transport from the popular vacation destination of Door County to beautiful, undisturbed Washington Island. The Washington Island Facebook page, managed by Insight, serves as a social hub for the islandâ€™s fans to share favorite memories, photos and stories while the Ferry staff can reciprocate with useful updates and information regarding schedules, weather and island news.
