The Boys and Girls Club of the Fox Valley provides a safe place for at-risk youth to learn and grow, create relationships with caring adult professionals and life-enhancing programs to help them realize their full potential. Insight donated time and talent to create an annual report for the Boys and Girls Club that beautifully illustrates their progress, financials and impact on the communities they serve.
