Bake My Day is a small family-owned bakery in Green Bay offering fresh baked sweets for everyday and special occasions. After establishing an identity of all things cute, from pink polka dots to loopy fonts, Insight designed a logo that appeals to the Bake My Day audience and highlights their specialty made-from-scratch cupcakes.
