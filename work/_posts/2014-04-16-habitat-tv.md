Habitat ReStore is a home improvement resale store that accepts and sells donations to fund Habitat for Humanity building projects in Northeast Wisconsin. Habitat ReStore challenged Insight to create a short, informative TV PSA to raise awareness of opportunities to support their cause, namely donating, shopping and volunteering at their stores in Green Bay and the Fox Cities.
