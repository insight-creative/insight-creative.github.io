Domino Printing Sciences, currently a global market leader in coding and marking for the food and beverage industry, identified a niche-market opportunity within pharmaceutical packaging after the announcement of an impending e-Pedigree law requiring serialization and specialized coding on all pharmaceuticals by January 2015.

## Goal

To develop an integrated marketing strategy that targets a select group within the pharmaceutical industry to increase recognition of Domino’s brand and educate them on the e-Pedigree law, while positioning Domino as the optimal coding solution, a knowledgeable consultant and valuable partner.

## Result

Together, Insight and Domino have helped to cure many of pharma’s serialization headaches through the educational campaign Coding for Compliance. Insight’s campaign efforts, including blogging, social media, trade show support, media relations, email marketing and educational videos, have shown great success and continue to generate revenue within Domino’s pharmaceutical sector.

The campaign’s blog was established as the primary hub for pharma packaging communication, educational resources and a forum for pharma professionals to talk directly with Domino’s experts. Social media channels including Twitter and Facebook pushed the Coding for Compliance name and message out to the appropriate audience. Facebook ads allowed for extremely detailed targeting to build campaign awareness and conversation with key decision makers.

Insight then brought Domino’s presence from on-screen to in-person offering creative support at national trade show events. Cleverly placed floor decals, signage and creative educational videos added personality while educating and building relationships at shows. One video became such a useful vehicle for Domino’s mission that it was translated into German at the request of the European arm of the company.

Coding for Compliance also gained international media buzz with the help of Insight’s determined media relations. Building editorial relationships within the pharma packaging news domain resulted in dozens of online mentions, in-depth interviews and printed features in renowned global industry publications including HealthCare Packing, PharmaVoice, Packaging World, and Pharmaceutical Online, among others. These media opportunities have given Domino both a presence and a voice in the worldwide serialization discussion.

After years collaborating on the Coding for Compliance campaign, the marketing team at Domino declares, “Insight Creative has truly become a valued extension of the Domino brand.”
