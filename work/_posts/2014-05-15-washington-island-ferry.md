The Ferry, the only source of transport from mainland Door County, Wisconsin—an upscale vacation destination—to Washington Island in Lake Michigan, was in need of a marketing overhaul to more effectively communicate with visitors who increasingly rely on technology for information and vacation planning.


## Goal

To effectively communicate with the thousands of tourists descending on Door County, Wisconsin every summer and let them know just what Washington Island has to offer as well as providing details—times, fares, rules, etc.—for riding the Ferry.

## Result

Ahoy! Insight jumped on board and developed a new logo and an amazing, informative and search engine friendly website for the 73-year-old ferry line! The new website offers locals and tourists all the details needed to ride the Ferry—a comprehensive timetable, fare info, rules, helpful hints and more. In addition the site offers a wealth of information on Washington Island dining, accommodations, tours, historical points and recreational information. The site’s live webcams, offering 24/7 views of the mainland and Island docks, is a favorite page destination for locals and visitors. The fun, new website received over 102,000 visits in one May–August vacation planning season, up 233% over the previous year.

Insight also made the Washington Island Ferry a force in social media. With a quickly expanding base of Ferry fanatics, the Facebook page is a shining example of social media engagement. Pictures are “Liked” and posts are commented on almost as soon as they are posted. Both tourists and local ferry lovers frequently submit photos and offer their own advice to others planning a Washington Island getaway. The Ferry’s Facebook page generated over 109,000 impressions with almost 42,000 users during one spring and summer season.

The new Ferry look and feel was applied to brochures, maps and radio spots. With adept media buying Insight provides statewide and regional coverage reaching Milwaukee, Chicago and Minneapolis.
