## Fostering a community on social media

How to develop and execute a cohesive social media campaign focusing on the Fox Cities Marathon three-day annual event that their community can actively “run with” all year-round?

## Goal

The client asked Insight to elevate the Fox Cities Marathon social media presence by posting frequent and creative content to popular social media channels encouraging online activity and sharing, generating interest and ultimately increasing participation.

## Result

The Fox Cities Marathon’s social media is officially “Powered By Insight!” Social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram have become an integral part of not only race-day activities, but year-round methods of communication to build motivation and camaraderie among athletes, volunteers, sponsors and a running enthusiast community that spans the nation! Strategic Facebook ads have built brand awareness, increased traffic to the website registration forms and have continuously elevated the total number of likes on the event’s timeline.

Since the inception of Insight’s social media efforts, registration for the event has grown rapidly. Fox Cities Marathon and Half Marathon registration for 2013 sold out over one month in advance of race day—the earliest registration has reached maximum capacity in the event’s 23-year history!
