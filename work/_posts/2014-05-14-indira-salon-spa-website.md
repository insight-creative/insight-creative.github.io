Indira Aveda Lifestyle Salon Spa recently modernized their brand to better exemplify their luxury products and services, appeal to their upscale and diverse client base, and properly represent AVEDA’s natural, organic approach. In addition to the brand overhaul, the salon also expanded their locations and menu of services.

## Goal

Create a completely new website—in both design and functionality—to reflect their updated brand, highlight their new locations and services, and provide mobile-friendly browsing to their tech-savvy clients.

## Result

INDIRA’s modern website makeover was a stunning success! The beautifully redesigned website not only showcases the contemporary and sophisticated INDIRA brand, the new earthy aesthetic also properly represents the philosophies of their product supplier, AVEDA. More content was added to the site, prompting improved navigation. Visitors are now met with a clean and intuitive menu, which applies to mobile users as well. The previous site, built in Flash, was not viewable on a smartphone or tablet. Now, mobile visitors are automatically directed to INDIRA’s custom mobile site where they can find pricing, purchase gift certificates, or even schedule appointments! The website was built in WordPress, enabling the client to make edits to content on their own as often as they’d like, a key component to website maintenance, especially in an industry where trends and products change often and continuously. Lastly, the new site also features better integration with INDIRA’s various social media platforms allowing customers to connect and share with INDIRA using the social platform of their choice.
