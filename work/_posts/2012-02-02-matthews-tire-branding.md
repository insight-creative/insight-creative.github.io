## Goal

In business since 1952, Matthews Tire is a successful chain of tire and automotive repair shops in Northeast Wisconsin. The tire business is extremely competitive—with constant pressure from car dealerships, big box stores and internet sales. Insight was determined to help Matthews consistently build on their reputation as a locally owned company known for great service, value and a unmatched tire expertise.

And customer satisfaction is constantly monitored via an online satisfaction survey. Together, these efforts keep Matthews’ marketing hitting on all cylinders!
