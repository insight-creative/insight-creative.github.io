Insight plans, buys and places all paid media for both Ministry and Affinity throughout northeast, central and northern Wisconsin—everything from ads in small high school sports programs to regional initiatives promoting all thirteen hospitals and 40+ clinics. Campaigns may feature oncology services, birthing centers, cardiology, orthopedics and more.  Most recently, St Elizabeth Hospital in Appleton, Wisconsin launched a new state-of-the-art hybrid OR. In four weeks time, Insight was able to deliver 1.2 million impressions and 1828 clicks to the website to view a video explaining the virtues of new facility—far exceeding the client’s goals for the campaign.
