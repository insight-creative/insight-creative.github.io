Insight represented Lakeview Credit Union for ten years. When Lakeview merged with Best Advantage and CitizensFirst credit unions, the combined entity had a big decision â€¦ bring their media buying in house or use one of the two agencies already working with the individual credit unions. Insight was honored to be selected for the job! The first task was creating a media buy that would help bring in a large increase in loan inquiries. With the very first media plan, Insight was able to deliver the result the client wanted. They were so impressed they extended the promotion another month and doubled the media campaign.
