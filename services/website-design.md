# Website Design and Development

## Our Process

Each website project generally is unique but we do try to keep our process for each project somewhat consistent. Splitting up a project into manageable phases helps us to stay on task and plan out a timeline to completion. A list of phases we go through for each website project can be found below:

### Research
- Account executive, web developers, and copywriters collaborate to gather all of the information necessary to begin working on the website, including all of the questions on the website questionnaire and any additional client requirements and expectations.  

### Estimate
- Web developers use information from research phase to create a rough site map in order to make an estimate on the overall cost of the site using the agencyâ€™s pricing formula.

### Site Map and Outline
- Web developers revise the site map and create an interactive outline of the site. Client reviews and adjusts or approves.

### Rough Draft
- Copywriters write a rough draft of the copy for the site, and the developers create rough page layouts and styles. Client reviews and approves the copy. Developers add copy to rough layouts to create a complete rough draft. Developers also prepare the development and live server if possible.

### Weekly Iterations
- Copywriters revise copy after feedback from client, and continue to do so with further rounds of feedback. Web developers refine rough draft of site, filling in missing pieces, improving site design and code, and responding to client feedback when available. Clients are provided with a link to follow along with updates as they are made.

### Launch
- Copywriters proofread the site, web developers launch the site after final approval.

### Maintenance
- Last minute bugs are fixed, the client makes any final requests after starting to actually use the site, and an ongoing web updates project is opened for any further changes.
