[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/page-promotions-terms) announced that third-party apps are no longer required for a brand page to administer a promotion, giveaway or sweepstakes. Now promotions can be hosted on a business’ timeline, in addition to third-party apps.

This allows small businesses to utilize a Facebook promotion to build awareness for a new product, new location, etc., where the costly third-party app previously hindered small companies with limited marketing budgets.

The [new rules to administer a Facebook promotion on a page timeline](https://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php) include:

- Collect entries by having users post on the page or comment/like a page post

- Collect entries by having users message the page

- Utilize likes as a voting mechanism

- Personal Timelines CANNOT be used to administer the promotion (asking users to tag themselves or their friends, asking users to share a post on their timeline or a friend’s timeline, etc.)

How will this affect your Facebook promotion strategy? Will your company now utilize a Facebook promotion to accomplish your goals?
