Happy Holidays from Ira the Elf! An elf’s job is to watch, listen and report back to the big guy. **Who sneaks out early? Who “borrows” yogurt from the fridge? Who leaves the copier in a jam?**

If you have an Elf on a Shelf, show us how he keeps watch at your office. Catch a shot of him … on a shelf … in a meeting … or help him take an elfie selfie! Share your photos–keep ‘em PG13 please–using #elfinsights on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Get inspired and enjoy a [gallery of #elfinsights photos on our Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151804863367727.1073741837.150343487726&type=1)
