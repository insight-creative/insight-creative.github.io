Whether you’re a professional writer or not, grammar is something we all struggle with from time to time. In some cases, fear of grammar mistakes hinder business owners and other professionals from even writing at all. As a copywriter here at Insight, this [Open Forum](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/explore/) article resonated with me and I hope it will inspire you to keep writing, even if the “grammar police” scold you. Gini Dietrick writes, “Get [the writing] out of you. It can always be fixed to perfection later. Few artists give birth to the work in perfect form. If you cannot write it for one reason or another, get it written by a professional. Don’t delay. You are unique, and your idea will perish with you if you don’t preserve it.”
