The Future 15 recognizes area young professionals that are growing and excelling in their respective fields. They influence the growth, prosperity and quality of life in Brown County and demonstrate the ability to positively impact the area in the future through professional accomplishments and community involvement, according to the Green Bay Area Chamber of Commerce website.

The following article originally appeared in a special section of the January 22, 2012 edition of the [Green Bay Press-Gazette](http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/ic/issuu/future152012.shtml) and is posted here with permission.

*When Alison Struve sets her mind to something, there is no getting in her way. Struve had always aspired to be on television. She landed a job as an anchor/producer/reporter at a Wausau station before moving to Green Bay and becoming a live reporter and fill-in anchor on FOX 11’s Good Day Wisconsin. But, after five years in TV news, she realized the career she spent her life preparing for was no longer a good fit. In 2010, Struve stepped out of her comfort zone, and embarked on a full-time job search.Not satisfied with the traditional method of blanketing the community with resumes, she created a website and blog to reach area employers. Insight Creative recognized her initiative and hired Struve as their first public relations/social media specialist.*

*Once on board, Struve was faced with the challenge of overcoming the huge learning curve ahead of her. Not one to be discouraged, Struve jumped in, revamping the firm’s social media presence and getting buy-in for the creation of an agency blog. She joined the local Public Relations Society of America and pledged to learn something new about her profession every day.*

*While she’d love to get involved in so many of the community’s worthy causes, Struve commits the majority of her volunteer time to the Brown County United Way and Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA). Social media, which fills her workday, is also what made her aware of CCFA. Inspired by a woman on Twitter, Struve felt this was one group she wanted to devote some of her time. With no obvious connection to the cause, the reporter in her made Struve want to raise awareness of this troubling disease. Through social media and word-of-mouth, Struve introduced the cause to those unfamiliar with it, and independently raised $3,600 for treatment and research. She continually relies on her communication skills and social media talents to make an impact on behalf of the organizations she’s involved in.*

*Originally from the area, Struve hopes to improve the quality of life in the community. She is passionate about diversity, feeling greater Green Bay would benefit from expanding the educational and networking opportunities for all residents.*

*Her heart goes out to children in low-income families. She said, “Getting parents the support they need to get their children on the right track will lead to success in education. My hope is those children will follow their dreams and give back to the community that supported them.” While Struve admits she isn’t a politician or city leader, she sees her role as figuring out how to build relationships and make connections to tackle the challenges in front of her. –– Jennifer Hogeland*

A word of thanks: “Thank you to my nominator, Courtney Svoboda of the Brown County Home Builders Association, for encouraging me to apply for the Future 15. I’ve also received a lot of support from the Insight Creative team, and I’d especially like to thank our president, Jim von Hoff, for his flexibility as I give time to multiple community efforts.”
