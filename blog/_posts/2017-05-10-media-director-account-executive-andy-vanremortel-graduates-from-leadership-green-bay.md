Insight Creative Account Executive/Media Director Andy VanRemortel graduated in the class of 2017 from [Leadership Green Bay](http://www.greatergbc.org/programs/leadership/leadership-green-bay) this May. The community-based program led by the Green Bay Chamber of Commerce admits 45 outstanding area professionals each year and runs from September to May.

Through the course of the program, professionals attend monthly meetings focusing on a variety of topics including government, economic development, education, health and human services and more equipping them to lead programs that affect change in our communities. For the final phase of the program, students assemble into teams, choose a local cause or problem to address, and develop sustainable solutions to ultimately contribute to the betterment of greater Green Bay.

VanRemortel's team selected the Dr. Rosa Minoka-Hill School for their final project. As an alternative K-12 school, the Minoka-Hill School serves students with a continuum of unique learning needs. Students are provided support to overcome personal challenges with the goal of transitioning back to their neighborhood or choice school, and ultimately graduating college, to be career and community ready.

Van Remortel's group identified that, due to a lack of funds, the school has never held a formal graduation. Their Leadership Green Bay group developed a sustainable graduation ceremony for the school that now includes caps and gowns, two $1,000 scholarships for the next five years and a venue (Green Bay East High School).

"Leadership Green Bay is a fantastic program," said VanRemortel. "It helps you look outside your regular day-to-day life and realize your community really needs you." While completing the program VanRemortel became inspired to extend his leadership talents beyond the duties of the program. He recently accepted positions on the board of directors for Golden House and the board of appeals for the City of De Pere.
