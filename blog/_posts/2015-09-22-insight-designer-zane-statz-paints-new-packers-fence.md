Insight Creative, Inc. graphic designer Zane Statz, alongside fellow St. Norbert alum and friend Spencer Young, volunteered their time and talents to paint a large-scale mural on the new Packers fence opposite the Lambeau Field Atrium. The new fence is sponsored by Cheesehead TV and was finished just in time for the rivalry matchup against the Seahawks Sunday, September 20th.

Estimated to be almost 70 feet long and six feet high, the mural features a Hulk-inspired illustration of Packers running back Eddie Lacy reaching for the Super Bowl 50 trophy with the simpl3 phrase “Cheesehead Nation.” The green and gold work of art stands out from the other theme-painted fences surrounding the stadium, as it’s the first to feature more than just a catchy phrase. Statz and Young each brought their unique talents to the project – Young with a brush and Statz with a spray can – taking fan fence painting to an entirely new level.

And Packer backers are taking notice. Many drivers, walkers and those passing by showed support by honking, waving and some stopping to observe as the artists worked throughout the day last Saturday. Even Lacy himself took notice of the artwork, sending this tweet to his 274,000 followers:
