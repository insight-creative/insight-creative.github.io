Did you know … “Promotional” email, such as e-newsletters and e-blasts, sent to Gmail accounts won’t land in an inbox anymore but will instead be routed to a new “Promotions” inbox found by navigating to a neighboring tab? Perhaps you’ve already received notice of this change?

In this [Businessweek article](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-19/is-the-new-gmail-killing-e-mail-marketing?campaign_id=yhoo), Google says its update is designed to make their users “happy.” Coincidentally, it just may spur additional sales of Gmail ads. What do you think? How do you think this will impact your email marketing campaigns?

If you are an Insight e-blast subscriber, we’ve already provided an email educating you on this development and how you can continue to receive our information in your inbox. See below for instructions on how to change this setting to make sure you don’t miss a thing!
