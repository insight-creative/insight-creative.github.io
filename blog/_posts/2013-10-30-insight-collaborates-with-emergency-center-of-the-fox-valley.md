[The Emergency Center of the Fox Valley](http://www.emergencyshelterfoxvalley.org/) is hosting their [Eighth Annual Benefit Gala](http://www.events.org/esfvgala/cpage.aspx?e=63290) Tuesday, November 12, 2013 at the Radisson Paper Valley Hotel in Appleton. The elegant evening includes a gourmet meal, live and silent auctions and an update on the shelter’s continuing community impact. Insight Creative, a full service marketing communications agency in Green Bay, has been donating their time and services in anticipation of the event to help further the shelter’s mission.Insight Creative President Jim von Hoff says, “We’re proud of the work we do at Insight, especially when it makes a positive impact in the community. When the Emergency Center of the Fox Valley approached us to help with the event, it was an easy decision to jump in and make a difference.”

Angela Schumacher, Creative Content Designer at Insight, has been working closely with Community Relations Director Jennifer Dieter at the shelter to complete a save-the-date email, printed invitation, and graphic design elements, to not only match the level of elegance attendees will experience at the event, but more importantly, bring increased attention to this worthy cause.

The pieces Schumacher created all help to bring awareness to the theme of the gala and the Emergency Shelter’s primary message: “Hope Has an Address,” reinforcing that no matter who you are, or what your need, there is a place you can go for help within the community.

“This project has really opened my eyes to homelessness in our community,” Schumacher said. “I was shocked to learn there are approximately 329 people in the Fox Valley who are homeless every night. The problem is much larger than I had imagined and the more I learn about the great things the shelter is doing, the more excited I am to help.”

Schumacher became so inspired, she’s helping to encourage others to discover ways they can help. During the gala, members of the Emergency Center will present their “Hope-ortunities,” a term coined by Schumacher to share ways that any person in the community can get involved by donating money, food, time or—like the staff at Insight—lending unique talents.

There’s still time to register for the gala! Reservations can be made online at [events.org/esfvgala](http://www.events.org/esfvgala/cpage.aspx?e=63290) by October 31, 2013.
