As part of today’s information age, building trust with prospective clients and customers is an enormous challenge. Your customers have the ability to educate themselves on their options long before they decide to walk through your door. The key is presenting yourself as an expert resource with relevant information that your prospect finds value in.

Traditionally, ‘sales leads’ meant digging up that old phonebook or contacts list and spending the day making cold calls in hopes of generating a handful of possibilities. Today’s reality? Potential clients no longer seek out your sales team to be educated on your product or service. They may finally reach out after they’ve validated you as a trusted option.

The roles of sales & marketing have shifted. ***Content marketing*** is becoming a focus of lead generation.

Today’s lead generation strategies shift the messaging from sales-oriented to buyer-centric. Providing free, relevant and relatable information [builds trust]() and your online authority in your industry. As you build trust with your prospective client, your content should continue to engage the discussion around the problem. People want to know that others identify with their problems and that a solution is truly focused on their needs.

###**Here’s the plan:**

Build a history with your visitors, so they come to expect interesting, relevant and ***free*** content from you. By consistently providing that content with unique value, you can eventually require some contact information from people who want your best content. In most cases, they’ll fill out a registration form on your website to gain access.

Once they are in your system, you can review their activity on your site. Find out what they’ve looked at, downloaded, registered for––whatever data will be the most relevant to your sales team. Equipped with this existing knowledge, they are the ones who will reach out to website visitors with tailored messages addressing specific needs.

The key is that your content is now more valuable than ever. How you present yourself –– your value proposition –– and how you demonstrate that through your content is how you can engage potential customers. People are going to research your company and services. The source of that information is up to you, but it would be advantageous if they can find the most relevant and [valuable content]() on your site or within your email campaigns.

This leads us back to content marketing – the creation and sharing of content with the goal to engage a specific audience. In the past, proprietary information would be closely guarded and shared only in the most secure situations. Today, that idea is changing to make some or all of this unique, high-value content available to specific audiences who will provide some information in exchange.

What qualifies as high-value content? First and foremost, it must educate the reader. Your readers are looking for **solutions to their problems**. They want to identify with your content. Consider the questions your current clients ask and develop content around those discussion points. Share success stories and tangible real-world examples with the results that your company delivered. Don’t just write pie-in-the-sky information. Include any downsides and expose the difficulties, but share how you overcame them. Demonstrating a realistic customer-centric viewpoint with your content will build trust and brand awareness, resonating with the buyer.

Having high-value content is a tremendous challenge in itself. But you also need to put tools in place to monitor, track and record visitor activity, giving your sales team access to quality leads. These tools have typically been out of reach for smaller businesses. Today, they are more affordable and make it easier for you to implement this powerful content marketing tactics.
