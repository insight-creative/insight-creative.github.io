NEW in 2013! Insight Creative introduced the [Fox Cities Marathon’s](http://foxcitiesmarathon.org/) first social media command center, called Social Media HQ, during the festival of races September 20-22, 2013.

Insight’s Social Media HQ was a physical space to bring the online interactions into real life conversations. Within the space, participants and their families learned about what coverage they could expect to find on the marathon’s social media channels, how to navigate those channels to find relevant content, plus, how to get involved on social media during the weekend by interacting with other participants and enjoying the fun photo area!

The Social Media HQ was located at the Health and Wellness Expo sponsored by Network Health on Friday and Saturday of race weekend. It featured a [fun, photo booth area](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151904708744925.1073741835.247587009924&type=3) operated by marathon volunteer photographers, a live Twitter feed displaying all tweets using the official event hashtag, #FCM2013, and power station for the Insight Social Media Team to re-juice during the live content capture of the weekend’s seven major events. It also served as a tweet-up location for fans to connect with [Ryan Sawlsville of ABC’s Extreme Makeover Weight Loss Edition.](https://www.facebook.com/Sawlsville)

During the marathon, half marathon and relay marathon events on Sunday, the Insight team positioned Social Media HQ at the finish line action and right beside the Media Tent to ensure the top finisher results were provided to fans and members of the media via social media in a timely and accurate manner.
