In the ever-changing word of website design and development, staying on top of current trends and tools being used help us create better looking and working websites. As web developers, new tools are being introduced regularly to help make our life easier and give us the ability to collaborate with one another. Thankfully most of these tools are free and come with documentation on how to use them effectively, so it really comes down to your willingness to learn something new. The best way of finding these tools are by reading website design and development blogs, some of my favorites are [Designer News](https://www.designernews.co), [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com), [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com) and [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com). There are many different tools out there but here are a few that we use regularly at Insight:

## [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
 - HTML, CSS and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web

Bootstrap is a tool that has helped us move away from making photoshop mock-ups and go strait to coding. We are able to quickly create wireframes of a new sites content, which can then be stylized later to match your desired look. A benefit we have found to this is that we can put this site up on a development server while we are working on it, send the client a link to view it. The client will then have the ability to interact with the sites functionality along with seeing the progress of their site as we are working on it.

## [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
 - simple, blog-aware, static site generator

We use Jekyll in tandem with Bootstrap for building a websites structure and makes the code easy to manage. Sections of code that are used over and over in your site can be linked to one another, meaning you only have to make a change to that code once for that change to appear everywhere else on the site that it is being used. Also with Jekyll we are able to write files in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers in a plain text format that is easy to read and write.

## [GitHub](https://github.com)
 - web-based service for version control and collaboration using Git

 With GitHub we are able collaborate with one another much easier. A sites code we are working on can be synced to each developers computer so that everyone is always working on the most recent version of that code. This means we can have more than one web developer working on a site at one time. This ability has helped speed up website projects and create more conversation during a project, increasing any problem solving that may occur.  Another great benefit of using GitHub is that it saves each commit (think of this as a save) you make, you can then go back to any of your commits and look at your code or start again from that spot. This ability has helped us experiment more with new features knowing that if we screw it up we can revert to where we were before.

These three tools are more of the well known ones out there but if you are not familiar with any of them itâ€™s a good place to get your feet wet. Here at Insight we are continually learning new tools and coding languages so we can better our clients needs on each project. Being able to collaborate more with one another has helped us challenge each other on staying current in the field. If website design or development is a field you are passionate about I encourage no to be afraid of trying new tools or languages as they come out.
